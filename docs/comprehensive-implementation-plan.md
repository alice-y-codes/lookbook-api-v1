# Wardrobe Social API: Comprehensive Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

The Wardrobe Social API is a backend system for a fashion-focused social media platform where users can curate and share outfits in a virtual wardrobe. The platform features a magazine-style layout for sharing outfits, collaborative features for users to interact, and a robust communication system. A key feature is the ability for friends to access each other's wardrobes and create outfits using items from their respective collections, with configurable privacy settings for both user accounts and wardrobes. Additional features include analytics dashboards, sustainability tracking, seasonal wardrobe management, and advanced search capabilities. This implementation plan outlines a Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach to building the system, with a phased MVP strategy to deliver incremental value.

**Important Note on Image Processing**: The actual processing of clothing images (background removal, transformation, and outfit composition) will be handled entirely on the client side (user's mobile device). The API's responsibility will be limited to receiving, storing, and serving these pre-processed images along with their metadata. This separation of concerns allows the API to focus on its core responsibilities while leveraging the processing capabilities of modern mobile devices.

14. Deliver a phased MVP approach to provide incremental value
15. Design for infrastructure flexibility to easily migrate between cloud providers
16. Implement a robust content moderation system to maintain community standards and safety

## Development Strategy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

All development will follow a strict TDD approach:

1. **Write Tests First**: For each feature, write tests that define the expected behavior before implementing the code
2. **Implement Code**: Write the minimum code necessary to pass the tests
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while ensuring tests continue to pass
4. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle for each feature

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles

The system will be built following DDD principles:

1. **Ubiquitous Language**: Establish a common language between developers and domain experts
2. **Bounded Contexts**: Define clear boundaries between different parts of the system
3. **Aggregates**: Identify aggregate roots that maintain consistency boundaries
4. **Entities and Value Objects**: Distinguish between objects with identity and those defined by their attributes
5. **Domain Events**: Use events to communicate between bounded contexts
6. **Repositories**: Abstract data access through repository interfaces

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

The system will be structured using hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters) to facilitate easy migration between different cloud services:

1. **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business logic and domain models, completely independent of external services
2. **Application Layer**: Orchestrates the use cases and application flow through ports (interfaces)
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides adapter implementations for external dependencies (databases, storage, etc.)
4. **API Layer**: Exposes the functionality through REST endpoints

#### Benefits for Cloud Service Migration

- **Database Portability**: By defining repository interfaces (ports) in the domain layer and implementing adapters in the infrastructure layer, we can easily switch between database providers (PostgreSQL on Render, AWS RDS, etc.)
- **Storage Service Flexibility**: Storage service adapters can be swapped without affecting the core application (S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.)
- **Messaging Independence**: Communication services can be changed by implementing new adapters (SQS, RabbitMQ, etc.)
- **Authentication Adaptability**: Authentication mechanisms can be modified without changing the core domain logic

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing the Wardrobe Social API using Test-Driven Development and Domain-Driven Design principles with a hexagonal architecture. By following a phased MVP approach, we can deliver incremental value while maintaining high quality and architectural integrity. The addition of analytics, sustainability features, seasonal management, advanced search capabilities, and a robust content moderation system will provide users with a safe, insightful, and engaging platform. The focus on clean architecture, security, testing, and documentation will ensure a robust and maintainable system that can evolve with changing requirements and easily migrate between different cloud service providers.

The clear separation of client-side image processing from server-side responsibilities ensures an optimal division of labor, with computation-intensive operations happening on user devices while the API focuses on its core strengths of data management, security, and service coordination. This approach not only optimizes performance but also reduces server costs and provides a more responsive user experience.

The outlined future enhancements provide a vision for growth beyond the initial implementation, creating a roadmap for continued development and feature expansion that can respond to user needs and market opportunities.
